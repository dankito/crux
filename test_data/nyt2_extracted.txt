WASHINGTON — An arms control treaty paring back American and Russian nuclear arsenals won a decisive vote in the Senate on Tuesday, clearing it for final approval and handing President Obama an important foreign policy victory. The Senate voted 67 to 28 to end debate on the treaty, known as New Start, mustering the two-thirds majority needed for ratification despite a concerted effort by Republican leaders to sink the agreement. Eleven Republican senators joined every Democrat present to support the treaty, which now heads to a seemingly certain final vote of approval on Wednesday. The outcome was another bipartisan victory for Mr. Obama, who emerged politically wounded from last month’s midterm elections but then successfully pressed Congress to enact several of his top priorities. At his behest, lawmakers passed an $858 billion package of tax cuts and unemployment benefits, and they ended the longstanding ban on gay men and lesbians’ serving openly in the military. New Start was the last major challenge of the session for Mr. Obama, and in some ways it was the clearest assertion of his authority in the face of an emboldened Republican Party. The tax-cut deal required the president to swallow a compromise that extended the lower, expiring Bush-era tax rates even for the wealthy, alienating much of his own party. The overturning of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” military policy was driven in the final days as much by senators as by the White House. By putting his prestige on the line to push through the treaty before the end of the year, Mr. Obama made the fight a high-profile test of his clout in the new political environment. Just a month ago, prospects for the treaty appeared bleak in the face of Republican resistance. But Mr. Obama mounted an unusually relentless campaign to win over enough Republican senators to bypass their party’s leaders. “Today’s bipartisan vote clears a significant hurdle in the Senate,” said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and the president’s chief ally on the floor. “We are on the brink of writing the next chapter in the 40-year history of wrestling with the threat of nuclear weapons.” Republican critics called it a bad deal, arguing that the treaty’s inspections were inadequate and that nonbinding language in its preamble could give Russia leverage to try to keep the United States from deploying missile defense installations in Eastern Europe. Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, led the opposition to an arms control treaty with Russia. “The administration did not negotiate a good treaty,” said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican and the leader of the opposition. “They went into negotiations, it seems to me, with the attitude with the Russians just like the guy that goes into the car dealership and says, ‘I’m not leaving here until I buy a car.’ ” The treaty requires the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear stockpiles so that within seven years of ratification neither deploys more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers. It would also resume the on-site inspections that lapsed last December with the expiration of the original Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or Start. The agreement brings down the legal ceilings set by previous Russian-American treaties that it would now supplant. Under the Treaty of Moscow, signed by President George W. Bush in 2002, each side is allowed no more than 2,200 warheads as of 2012. Under Start, signed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991, each side was required to reduce launchers to 1,600 before it expired last year. The United States currently has 1,950 deployed strategic warheads and 798 deployed launchers, according to the Federation of American Scientists, while Russia has 2,540 deployed strategic warheads and 574 strategic launchers. Because of counting rules, each side may not have to shelve as many weapons as those numbers imply, according to experts. The debate over the treaty, however, ranged far beyond the numbers, revealing starkly different visions for national security in the 21st century. Mr. Obama and his supporters argued that ratification was essential to rebuilding a relationship with Russia and maintaining the international coalition against Iran’s nuclear program. His critics said it represented a first step toward a dangerous and wrong-headed vision of eventually eliminating the world’s nuclear weapons. It also became entangled in issues like gay men and lesbians in the military, which some Republicans said poisoned the water for the treaty. And some critics questioned Mr. Obama’s willingness as commander in chief to resist Russian pressure to drop missile defense to preserve the pact down the road. “I cannot imagine this president taking it to the limit with the Russians because nothing he has done has convinced me that he is committed to missile defense,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who added that it was “a monumental mistake” to approve the treaty in a lame-duck session. Senators John Kerry, left, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, rallied votes for New Start. But the White House cast Mr. Obama in the shadow of President Ronald Reagan, who also talked of ridding the world of nuclear weapons. “Our reductions in these are legacies of many presidents, including former President Ronald Reagan,” said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary. “And it makes the world safer.” Mr. Obama enlisted the elder Mr. Bush, former Republican secretaries of state, the nation’s military commanders and Eastern European leaders to knock down objections. Every time a Republican needed assurance about missile defense, verification or nuclear modernization, supporters produced letters or statements from prominent figures. In a final such letter to several senators, released Tuesday, Mr. Obama repeated his commitment to a 10-year, $85 billion program to modernize the nation’s nuclear weapons complex to ensure that a shrinking nuclear arsenal would still be effective. “My administration will pursue these programs and capabilities for as long as I am president,” he wrote. With Mr. Obama working the phones and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Capitol Hill, the reassurances won over Republicans like Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Johnny Isakson of Georgia, all of whom announced their support just before Tuesday’s vote. “I’m convinced that America is safer and more secure with the New Start treaty than without it,” said Mr. Alexander, who just last week voted to block consideration of the pact on the floor. He cited Mr. Obama’s modernization letter and added that the treaty still left the United States with “enough nuclear warheads to blow any attacker to kingdom come.” Other Republicans who voted to advance the treaty on Tuesday were Senators Robert F. Bennett of Utah, Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and George V. Voinovich of Ohio. The vote cleared the way for a final vote, although senators discussed a number of Republican amendments late into the night. Mr. Kerry accepted two Republican-sponsored side statements that called for modernizing nuclear delivery systems and opening new talks with Russia to reduce tactical nuclear weapons. The fate of another provision on missile defense, sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, remained undecided. For final passage, the Constitution requires two-thirds of senators present. With Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, absent after prostate surgery, that means supporters need 66 votes. The Russian Parliament must approve the treaty as well, but given the Kremlin’s dominance, that is considered a formality.
