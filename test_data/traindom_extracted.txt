Photo used under Creative Commons from theparadigmshifter So you have a new startup company and want some coverage. This post will give you 36 places where you can submit your startup for reviews, mentions or at least some backlinks. When we launched our public beta in April, the first thing we wanted was some coverage on different startup blogs and websites. We didn’t have a PR company or a bunch of contacts, hence we needed to start from scratch So I took my sweet time Googling different websites that would take submissions, tips or published their editor’s email. Initially the list got pretty big, but I weeded out websites where you need to be way bigger to get mentioned (Mashable, Techcrunch and the like) or that charge money for a review. We were pretty happy with the coverage we got and I thought I’ll save you some time by sharing my list. 38. The Atlantic Technology Channel (thanks Alexis) Know of any other good ones?

We also sent out a press release manually, targeting specific magazines & newspapers.
