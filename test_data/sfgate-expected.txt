"There is evidence there's less distress out there, but it's still at abnormally high levels," said Andrew LePage, an analyst with MDA DataQuick, the San Diego real estate information firm that published the report. In the third quarter, the nine-county Bay Area saw 12,690 default notices, which are sent after three months or more of missed payments. That was down 32.5 percent from a year ago, but up slightly from the second quarter. Over the past 15 years, the region's quarterly average for default notices was 6,231, so activity is still twice as high as normal. The results cover the three months that ended in September, so do not reflect fallout from the recent controversy over sloppy bank paperwork in foreclosures. Bank of America, for instance, temporarily halted foreclosures nationwide this month. Statewide, there were 83,261 default notices in the third quarter, down 25.5 percent from a year earlier, but up 18.9 percent from the second quarter. Trustee deeds, the final step of repossessing houses in foreclosure, stood at 6,757 for the Bay Area, down 9.4 percent compared with a year earlier and about the same as the prior quarter. Statewide, 45,377 trustee deeds were filed, down 9.3 percent from a year earlier and down 4.8 percent from the second quarter. The foreclosure rate is more than triple the historical average. Over the past 15 years, an average of 1,960 Bay Area homes were repossessed by lenders each quarter. In a reverse of a recent trend, foreclosure activity was down in higher-end neighborhoods. California ZIP codes where the median sales price was above $800,000 saw defaults decrease 29.3 percent from this time last year.
