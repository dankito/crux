If you find yourself with lots of leftover wood (from carpentry projects and the like), you don't need to waste them. By building a rocket stove, you can heat your house with just a handful of wood. Unlike a regular wood stove, a rocket stove is very efficient, burning a small amount of wood at an extremely high temperature. To build one, you'll need a steel drum of sorts—this particular model used an old electric hot water tank—along with some steel pipe, square tubing, and some flexible aluminum tubing to empty the exhaust into the fireplace. You'll also need some welding skills, as it's a pretty heavy-duty project. Note that you'll definitely want to look closely at your municipality codes and fire insurance, as this could cause problems with both. What's nice about its efficiency, though, is that it makes it safer than other similar projects—since you're only burning a small amount of wood, you have to refill it every 30 minutes or so, making sure that you keep a constant eye on it. Furthermore, the exhaust is pretty cool by the time it reaches the aluminum tubing, and the whole thing heats your house so well that you may not need it running all the time.
