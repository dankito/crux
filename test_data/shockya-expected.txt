New Kids On The Block singer Jonathan Knight has publicly revealed that he is gay, EW.com is reporting. The boy band’s former tourmate, Tiffany, who dated Knight during their height of fame in the 1980s, accidentally revealed the news when she recently appeared on Bravo’s ‘Watch What Happens Live.’ While Knight’s publicist told Entertainment Weekly in response that he has “never spoken publicly spoken about his sexuality and doesn’t intend to start,” the singer officially confirmed the news on a fan members-only website. Knight said “I have never been outed by anyone but myself! I did so almost twenty years ago. I never knew that I would have to do it all over again publicly just because I reunited with NKOTB!” Knight continued by saying he has lived his life very openly, and has “never hidden the fact that I am gay! Apparently the pre requisite to being a gay public figure is to appear on the cover a magazine with the caption ‘I am gay.’ He also said that it’s his belief that people live their lives by example, and “not by a caption on a magazine!” The singer, who is reuniting with his New Kids On The Block bandmates for their joint summer tour with the Backstreet Boys, added that “I love living my life being open and honest, but at this time I choose not to discuss my private life any further!”
