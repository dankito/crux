PHILADELPHIA -- Michael Vick missed practice Thursday because of a leg injury and is unlikely to play Sunday when the Eagles host Dallas. The NFC East champion Eagles (10-5) are locked into the No. 3 seed, so Vick may not have played even if he was completely healthy. Coach Andy Reid has rested his starters in other meaningless games before the playoffs in past years. Vick, selected to his fourth Pro Bowl this season, hurt his quad on the first play in Philadelphia's 24-14 upset loss to Minnesota on Saturday. The team has not said which leg he hurt. Kevin Kolb, the starter in Week 1, would make his fifth start this season in Vick's place. "If I approach it any other way, then I'll be a step behind," Kolb said. "I want to approach it like I'm going to be out there, take all the reps mentally that I can. Make sure I'm paying attention to the details." Kolb became the Eagles' No. 1 quarterback after Donovan McNabb was traded to Washington. He served as McNabb's backup for three seasons and became the first QB ever to throw for 300 yards in each of his first two career starts last year. Kolb suffered a concussion in Week 1, paving the way for Vick to take over. Vick set career highs this season in yards passing (3,018), touchdowns passing (21) and touchdowns rushing (nine). Kolb is signed through 2011 and Vick is in the final year of a two-year contract. Kolb doesn't look at Sunday's game as an audition for another team. He'd like to stay with the Eagles, who almost certainly will bring Vick back. "I like this team so much and I enjoy being around Mike so much that I think it's an injustice to the team to put my focus anywhere else, because what happens if they call on me this week, in the playoffs, whenever?" Kolb said. "There's plenty of time for that this offseason. When that time comes, I'll give it thought, but right now I'm focused on winning this next football game and hopefully going to win a Super Bowl."
