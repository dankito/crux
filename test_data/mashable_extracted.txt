Imagine, if you will, a crowded dance floor: Men and women are talking, laughing awkwardly and trying to gyrate their rhythmically challenged hips to that Phoenix song that goes “do let, do let, blah blah.” One lone man ceases undulating to put his lips to the ear of the chick he’s grinding up on. “Hey,” he purrs, “Can I get your Twitter handle?” We’ve reached that point, folks: the zenith of awkwardness whereby the cables of communication are so plentiful that we are wound in a web of our own making. In a sense, we have returned to the tangled days of Emily Post-esque courting etiquette — circa 1922 — whereby men left women calling cards and letters of introduction, not actually seeing the women themselves upon delivery, unless it was between 4 and 6 o’clock (yes, these were the actual rules). Though we no longer carry engraved cards (2¾ to 3½ inches wide by 2 to 2¾ inches high), we do tout around the modern equivalent: a slew of digital identities that potential suitors must circumvent to get to the actual you. While we admit that fixing the above issue wholesale would require a total brain-scrub of the world’s populace, we are prepared to offer a few date-making tips for all you hopeless (emphasis on the hopeless) romantics. And so begins my Netiquette column — which I write with my Stuff Hipsters Hate co-blogger, Andrea Bartz — this week over at CNN.
