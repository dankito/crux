There are literally dozens of ways to predetermine who should (and will) win the 2011 NBA title. When this particular hoop junkie started loving this game (like the NBA’s theme song of ‘94 told me that I should), my eighth grade math skills were put to good use (for arguably the very first time ever) by creating a simple and easy to follow formula. Eager to win every basketball argument, this blogger decided to rank each starting C, PF, SF, SG, PG (as well as each team’s sixth man, head coach and bench), from 1-30. Once ranked, it was a simple matter of addition and, BAM!, instant NBA pecking order. Simple enough, right? What’s interesting is that the respective positional rankings not only highlight roster weaknesses but they showcase how overall rankings are not all that adversely affected by one or two positional re-orders – should one disagree with how they’ve been presented below. Overall franchise strength (and not muscle at a singular position) is on display below – which explains why so many teams, (we’re looking at you Miami and Oklahoma City) don’t appear where the collective may believe they should. Point being, it’s better to score average in all eight categories than it is to standout in a few. But, as we all know, the NBA isn’t played on paper so no point fretting. With the ’10-11 season still in its infancy, it’s time to put this 15-year-old formula to the test. So where will each team finish at season’s end, given the rosters which have been assembled?
