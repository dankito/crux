You love to punch your arms through the air, like you’re beating up ghosts. You wish you could be part of a Fight Club. You have an Xbox 360 and may have a Kinect. There is a game for you. The game is called Fighters Uncaged, and it appears to be publisher Ubisoft’s answer to PlayStation Move motion-controlled fighting game The Fight: Lights Out (formerly known as Motion Fighter when we first played it). Both games reject the sunny mood of your average motion-controlled console video game in the interest of letting you shadow-box in grimy places against grimy virtual people. The Ubisoft press release letting us know today that this game exists describes a game that lets you use 70 combat moves. Quoting the press release: “Fight using your fists, knees, legs, elbows and even your head to take out opponents. Body tracking allows for accurate dodging and blocking of incoming strikes delivering players directly into the game.” The game has a training system and leaderboards but does not appear to have local multiplayer. Maybe Kinect wouldn’t support that. Or maybe it would just be too dangerous.
