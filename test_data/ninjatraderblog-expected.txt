You can Google everything and all these queries which you write on Google, will get a website to have a nice ranking or lose their ranking. Those who rely on forum posting, email spamming and the other black hat SEO will not get the results they want. They may get on Google’s first page for a short time, then their keyword ranking disappears. Those SEO software programs won’t help you anymore.
