*Not* what you want to see on the fetal monitor when your wife begins to push. Thanks, Microsoft. It's not Microsoft's fault the hospital's IT department haven't configured the PC properly @lifenstein Hospitals IT departments are very much dictated to re OS used , not the other way round Unfortunately most medical equipment suppliers seem to use XP these days :( That's WinXP, a decade old OS. You shouldn't blame MS for the Hospital's IT department being cheap. @blinkingled - workstation probably isn't connected to the Internet. Dont have to be on the Internet to get updates. LoL! It's a metaphor: even before birth, Windows needs to update #fail Why on earth is any hospital machine connected to the Internet in first place? That's insane. hilarious. at least it wasn't a bsod. and congratulations! On my wife's turn, I will check for the hospital not having Windows bt Linux now... hahahha.. Windows sucks.. hahaha I think at this point the wife is pretty much clueless;-/ Would love to have seen the wife when husband paused to take a picture of the monitor "Action failed. You need admin rights to have a baby. Press any key to continue." its a bad sign that i automatically tried to click 'restart later' on this picture.
